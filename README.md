chromeConnect
=============

## About
ChromeConnect enables a user to turn their cell phone or tablet into a mouse to control their browser experience in chrome. The functionality currently supports mouse control with clicks, as well as the ability to zoom by pinching and two-finger scrolling up or down the page. 

This extension captures gesture interactions taken from a paired mobile or tablet device, and incorporates the gesturing data into the navigation experience within your browser. ChromeConnect is an open source project and is currently in alpha testing phase.
